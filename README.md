## WINEMU

**An ambitious project to create a 64-bit operating system emulator running directly in your web browser.**

### Technologies

* **Backend:** Django (Python)
* **Frontend:** *To be defined*
* **Emulator:** C++ compiled to WebAssembly (CPU, registers, memory)

### Description

WINEMU aims to build a 64-bit operating system emulator that can run directly in your web browser. This will enable native application execution on the web, opening up a world of possibilities.

### Contributions

We welcome contributions of all kinds. If you have ideas, improvements, or want to collaborate on development, feel free to:

* Create an issue to suggest new features or report problems.
* Submit a pull request with your changes.

### Next steps

* **Architecture design:** Define in detail the emulator's structure and its interaction with the backend and frontend.
* **Core development:** Implement the CPU, registers, and memory management in C++.
* **WebAssembly integration:** Compile the C++ code to WebAssembly for execution in the browser.
* **Frontend development:** Create an intuitive user interface to interact with the emulator.
